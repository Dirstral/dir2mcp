# Sourdough Bread

Rustic bread with a crispy crust and open crumb — takes patience but minimal hands-on time.

## Ingredients

- 400 g bread flour (or all-purpose)
- 100 g whole wheat or rye flour
- 100 g active sourdough starter (fed, risen)
- 350 ml lukewarm water
- 10 g salt

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | What happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Mix dough | 10 min | Combine everything |
| Autolyse | 30 min | Flour hydrates |
| Stretch & fold | 2 hrs | Fold every 30 min (4×) |
| Bulk ferment | 3-5 hrs | Dough doubles |
| Shape | 10 min | Pre-shape, into banneton |
| Cold proof | 8-16 hrs | Overnight in fridge |
| Bake | 45 min | In Dutch oven |

## Instructions

1. **Mix:** Combine flours, water and starter in a large bowl by hand. Rest 30 minutes (autolyse). Then work in the salt.

2. **Stretch and fold:** Over 2 hours, stretch and fold every 30 minutes: pull one side up and fold to center, rotate bowl 90°, repeat 4 times. Do this 4 rounds total.

3. **Bulk ferment:** Cover and leave at room temperature (21-24°C) for 3-5 hours until dough has risen 50-75%. Surface bubbles are a good sign.

4. **Shape:** Turn dough onto a floured surface. Gently shape into a round (pre-shape). Place seam-side up in a floured banneton. Cover.

5. **Cold proof:** Refrigerate overnight (8-16 hours).

6. **Bake:** Preheat oven to 250°C / 480°F with Dutch oven inside (at least 45 min). Turn dough into hot pot, score the top, lid on. Bake 25 min covered, then 20 min uncovered at 230°C / 450°F.

7. **Cool:** Let cool completely on a wire rack (at least 1 hour!). Cutting too early ruins the crumb.

## Tips

- Starter must be active (doubles in 4-6 hours after feeding)
- Poke test: Press floured finger into dough — springs back slowly = ready
- No Dutch oven? Bake on a pizza stone with a tray of water for steam
- The bread sounds hollow when you tap the bottom = done
