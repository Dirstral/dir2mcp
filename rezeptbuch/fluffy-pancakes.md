# Fluffy American Pancakes

Thick, fluffy and golden — the perfect weekend breakfast.

## Ingredients (~10 pancakes)

- 200 g all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 2 tbsp sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 250 ml buttermilk
- 60 ml milk
- 1 large egg
- 30 g melted butter + more for the pan
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

### Toppings (pick your favorites)
- Maple syrup
- Fresh blueberries or sliced banana
- Butter
- Whipped cream
- Crispy bacon (sweet-salty combo!)
- Nutella
- Cinnamon and powdered sugar

## Instructions

1. **Dry ingredients:** Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt in a large bowl.

2. **Wet ingredients:** In a separate bowl, whisk buttermilk, milk, egg, melted butter and vanilla.

3. **Combine:** Pour wet into dry and stir BRIEFLY. The batter SHOULD have lumps. Over-mixing = tough pancakes.

4. **Rest:** Let sit 5 minutes. The surface will get bubbles — that's the baking powder working.

5. **Cook:** Brush a pan with butter over medium heat. Pour about 60 ml batter per pancake. Wait until bubbles form on the surface and edges look set (2-3 min). Flip. Cook 1-2 more minutes.

6. **Keep warm:** Hold finished pancakes in a 80°C / 175°F oven while you cook the rest.

## The Science of Fluffiness

1. **Buttermilk + baking soda** = chemical reaction = CO2 bubbles = fluffy
2. **Don't over-mix** — gluten develops with stirring and makes batter tough
3. **Medium heat** — too hot = burnt outside, raw inside
4. **Resting the batter** — flour absorbs liquid, baking powder activates

## Variations

- **Blueberry:** Drop berries directly onto batter in the pan (don't fold in)
- **Banana:** Mash a ripe banana into the batter
- **Chocolate chip:** Fold chips into batter gently
- **Whole wheat:** Replace half the flour with whole wheat (add a splash more milk)
