# Tiramisu

Classic Italian no-bake dessert — best when made the day before.

## Ingredients (6 servings)

- 500 g mascarpone
- 4 egg yolks
- 100 g sugar
- 300 ml strong espresso (cooled)
- 3 tbsp Amaretto or Marsala
- 200 g ladyfingers (Savoiardi)
- 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
- Pinch of salt

## Instructions

1. **Make the cream:** Beat egg yolks with sugar and salt until pale and fluffy (about 5 minutes). Fold in mascarpone until smooth.

2. **Prepare espresso:** Mix espresso with Amaretto in a shallow dish.

3. **Layer:** Briefly dip ladyfingers into espresso (1-2 seconds per side — don't soak them). Arrange a layer in a dish (approx. 20×30 cm). Spread half the mascarpone cream on top. Repeat with a second layer of ladyfingers and remaining cream.

4. **Chill:** Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

5. **Serve:** Dust generously with cocoa powder before serving.

## Tips

- Really only dip the ladyfingers briefly — soggy tiramisu is the #1 mistake
- Skip the alcohol if you prefer; just use a bit more espresso
- Keeps 2-3 days in the fridge
- Variation: Top with grated dark chocolate instead of cocoa
