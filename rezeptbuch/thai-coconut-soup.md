## Tom Kha vs Tom Yum

| | Tom Kha Gai | Tom Yum |
|---|---|---|
| Base | Coconut milk + stock | Stock only |
| Flavor | Creamy, mild-spicy | Clear, hot-sour |
| Color | White-creamy | Translucent-red |
| Heat level | Mild-medium | Medium-hot |

## Tips

- Lemongrass, galangal and lime leaves are NOT meant to be eaten — they only add aroma
- Galangal tastes different from ginger (more citrusy, less sharp)
- Vegan: Swap chicken for tofu, fish sauce for soy sauce, use vegetable stock
- Freezes well — coconut milk may separate slightly, just stir
