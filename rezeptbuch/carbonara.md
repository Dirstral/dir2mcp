# Spaghetti Carbonara

The Roman original — only 5 ingredients, absolutely no cream.

## Ingredients (2 servings)

- 200 g spaghetti (or rigatoni)
- 150 g guanciale (cured pork cheek) — or pancetta as backup
- 3 egg yolks + 1 whole egg
- 80 g Pecorino Romano (finely grated)
- Black pepper (freshly ground, generous)
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. **Pasta water:** Bring a large pot of water to boil. Salt it well (should taste like the sea).

2. **Cook guanciale:** Cut into small batons. Start in a COLD pan on medium heat, render slowly until fat is released and pieces are crispy (8-10 min). Remove pan from heat.

3. **Egg-cheese mix:** Whisk egg yolks, whole egg, Pecorino and plenty of pepper in a bowl. Should be a thick paste.

4. **Cook pasta:** Boil spaghetti al dente. Reserve 1-2 ladles of pasta water (!). Drain.

5. **The critical moment:** Add hot pasta to the pan with guanciale (heat OFF). Toss for 30 seconds. Then add the egg-cheese mixture and immediately toss/stir vigorously. Add pasta water spoonful by spoonful until you get a creamy, silky sauce.

6. **Serve:** Immediately on warm plates. More Pecorino and pepper on top.

## The Rules

- **NO CREAM** — the creaminess comes only from egg + cheese + pasta water
- **Heat must be OFF** when mixing — otherwise you get scrambled eggs
- **Pasta water is the key** — the starch emulsifies the sauce
- Guanciale > Pancetta > Bacon (in order of authenticity)

## Common Mistakes

1. Egg mixture hits too-hot pasta = scrambled egg disaster
2. Too little pepper — carbonara should be peppery
3. Sauce too thick → add more pasta water; too thin → add more Pecorino
4. Using Parmesan instead of Pecorino — works but isn't authentic
