# Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani)

Creamy Indian curry — mild, aromatic, the ultimate crowd-pleaser.

## Ingredients (4 servings)

### Marinade
- 500 g chicken breast (cubed)
- 150 g plain yogurt
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp mild chili powder
- 1 tsp salt

### Sauce
- 400 g crushed tomatoes (passata)
- 200 ml heavy cream
- 50 g butter
- 1 large onion (finely diced)
- 3 cloves garlic (minced)
- Thumb-sized piece of ginger (grated)
- 2 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 2 cardamom pods
- 1 tbsp honey or sugar
- Salt to taste

### Serve with
- Basmati rice or naan bread
- Fresh cilantro for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Marinate:** Mix chicken with all marinade ingredients. Refrigerate at least 2 hours, ideally overnight.

2. **Sear chicken:** Cook marinated chicken in a hot pan with oil until browned on all sides (doesn't need to be cooked through — it'll finish in the sauce). Set aside.

3. **Sauce base:** Melt butter in a large pot. Sauté onion until translucent (5 min). Add garlic and ginger, cook 1 minute until fragrant.

4. **Spices:** Add all spices (garam masala, turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom). Toast for 30 seconds while stirring.

5. **Tomatoes and cream:** Stir in crushed tomatoes, bring to a simmer. Cook 15 minutes. Stir in cream and honey.

6. **Optional:** Blend with an immersion blender for a velvety smooth sauce (or leave chunky for more texture).

7. **Finish chicken:** Add chicken pieces to the sauce. Simmer 10-15 minutes on medium heat until chicken is cooked through.

8. **Serve:** Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve with basmati rice or warm naan.

## Tips

- Overnight marinating makes a huge difference in flavor
- Fish out the cardamom pods before serving
- Want it spicier? Add 1-2 green chilies while cooking
- Leftovers taste even better the next day (flavors develop overnight)
- Vegan version: Swap chicken for cauliflower, yogurt for coconut yogurt, cream for coconut milk
